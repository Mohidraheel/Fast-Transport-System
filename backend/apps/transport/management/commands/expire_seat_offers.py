"""
Release seats whose payment deadline has passed.

A promoted student holds a seat for SEAT_OFFER_HOURS. If they do not pay in
that window the seat is released, which cascades into promoting the next
student in the queue (via the post_delete receiver in signals.py).

Run this on a schedule — e.g. hourly:

    python manage.py expire_seat_offers --settings=config.settings.prod

Use --dry-run to see what would be released without changing anything.
